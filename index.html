                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in
                    prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and
                    skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate
                    societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation.
                    Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one
                    generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their
                    knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                    through imitation, formal education developed. Schools
                    existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.[6]
                    Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the Chinese
                    edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607
                    Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution
                    of higher learning in Europe.[7] The city of Alexandria in
                    Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to
                    Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece. There,
                    the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century
                    BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy
                    and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.</p>

                <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of
                    facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge,
                    skills, values, morals, beliefs, habits, and personal
                    development.[1] Education originated as transmission of
                    cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today,
                    educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as
                    liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented
                    information, skills needed for the modern society, empathy
                    and complex vocational skills.</p>

                    support early development in preparation for participation
                    in school and society. The programmes are designed for
                    children below the age of 3. This is ISCED level 01.[21]
                    Preschools provide education from ages approximately three
                    to seven, depending on the country when children enter
                    primary education. The children now readily interact with
                    their peers and the educator.[21] These are also known as
                    nursery schools and as kindergarten, except in the US, where
                    the term kindergarten refers to the earliest levels of
                    primary education.[23] Kindergarten "provides a
                    child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to
                    seven-year-old children that aim[s] at unfolding the child's
                    physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced
                    emphasis on each of them."[24] This is ISCED level 02.[21]</p>
